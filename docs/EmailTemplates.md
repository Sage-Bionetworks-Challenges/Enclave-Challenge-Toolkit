# NEED TO JOIN A TEAM AND REGISTER

Hello Long COVID challenge participant!

If you are receiving this email, we have received your request for access to the challenge project space within the N3C enclave; however, we haven't been able to link you to a Synapse account.

Please make sure: 
1. You have created a Synapse account (https://www.synapse.org/#!RegisterAccount:0)
2. Your Synapse profile first name and last name match those on your N3C account. 
3. You have registered for the Long COVID Computational Challenge (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn33576900/wiki/).
4. You are part of a Team (https://help.synapse.org/docs/Teams.1985446029.html) that is registered with the challenge. (See step 3)(https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn33576900/wiki/618454)

You will be admitted into the project space once we can link you to a challenge registered Synapse account and you have joined a Team registered with the challenge.

Thank you and we look forward to having you in this challenge!

# NEED TO JOIN A TEAM ONLY

Hello Long COVID challenge participant!

If you are receiving this email, you are nearly ready to be onboarded into challenge project space within the N3C enclave, but haven't associated your Synapse account with a Team. 

You can do one of two options: 
1. create and join a team (https://help.synapse.org/docs/Teams.1985446029.html) in Synapse, even if you are the only person on the team, and register that team with the challenge, or 
2. join an existing team(https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn33576900/wiki/618459) that has already been created and registered with the challenge. (See step 3 of the instructions for more info)(https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn33576900/wiki/618454)

You will be admitted into the project space once you have joined a Team that is registered with the challenge.

Thank you and we look forward to having you in this challenge!
